This is the fifth program derived from 100 program suggested by ChatGPT for a 4 week python course. My main goal is to pay close attention to pythonic syntax, creating/updating git repositories, and developing good commenting habits. Upon completing this program, I'll push it to github and request feedback from my peers.

The following ChatGPT prompts was used to develop this program:
18. Print all numbers from 1 to 100, but for multiples of three, print "Fizz" instead, and for multiples of five, print "Buzz." For numbers that are multiples of both three and five, print "FizzBuzz."
